# Viljami.dev Portfolio (very much WIP)

This is the source code for my portfolio site [viljami.dev](https://viljami.dev). It's built with Next.js, Typescript, and React. There are also 3D elements written with @react-three/fiber and three.js. Content is managed with Contentful.

### Setup
Create a `.env.local` file. (You'll need to setup Contentful first)
```
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=
```

### Running the code

```
npm run dev
```
